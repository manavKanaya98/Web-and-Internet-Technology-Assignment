<h2>Information</h2>
<p id="information1">My program works by displaying randomly generated images of elephants and fish in the grid. If a user clicks on the image, it gets marked by a green dot in the 
   bottom corner of the image. When the user has finished they can press the 'verify' button to check their selection. If their selection is detected correct, an image of 
   a 'smiley face' is displayed and if their selection does not match what the prompt is asking for, then an image of a red exclamation mark is displayed. When the user 
   presses the 'reinitialise' button, the program restarts and a new set of images are displayed.

  My website is displayable on both mobile and desktop browser sceens and I tested the website on both the desktop and mobile modes in Microsoft Edge. When testing the website
  using mobile mode, I tested with different sizes of mobile screens such as the iPhone 12 Pro screen size and the Samsung Galaxy S8 + screen size. Using the developer tools 
  in Microsoft Edge, I also checked how the website looked on screens slightly larger than a phone such as on an iPad Pro.
